# Information-Retrieval

1. Pre-processing of a Text Document: Accent removal, stop word removal and stemming. Step by step pre-processing including necessary statistics at each step.
2. Implementation of Inverted index: Construction and searching.
3. Implementation of Vector Space Model.
4. Implementation of probabilistic Model. 
    A. Rank 10 documents for a given query.
    B. Compare performance of two IR algorithms for the same query q.
    C. Calculate harmonic mean and E- measure (All three cases b=1, b&gt;1, b&lt;1).
5. Implementation of various evaluation measures. 
    A. Calculate recall and precision values for all relevant documents and draw precision VS Recall Curve. Also calculate R-precision.
    B. Compare performance of two IR algorithms for the same query q. C. Calculate harmonic mean and E- measure (All three cases b=1, b&gt;1, b&lt;1). Compare performance of two IR algorithms for the same query q. C. Calculate harmonic mean and E- measure (All three cases b=1, b&gt;1, b&lt;1).
    C. Compare performance of two IR algorithms for the same query q.
    D. Calculate harmonic mean and E- measure (All three cases b=1, b>1, b<1).
